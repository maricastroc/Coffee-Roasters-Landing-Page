<h2>:computer: What I Learned</h2>
<p>This was my first large-scale project and, despite taking the time to think about how to build the different functionalities with clean and organized code, I came across some challenges, mainly related to the styling of the elements and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Using the SASS preprocessor helped me promote better readability within my code. Also, this was my first project with a Mobile First approach, which was essential to be able to adapt the layout and its functionalities to different devices.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I can see how not using a framework would make this multi-page websites difficult to maintain and update. That's why I'm now focusing on learning React JS.</p>
