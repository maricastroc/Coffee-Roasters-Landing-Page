## üìå What did I learn?

This was my first large-scale project and, despite taking the time to think about how to build the different functionalities with clean and organized code, I came across some challenges, mainly related to the styling of the elements and responsiveness.

Using the SASS preprocessor helped me promote better readability within my code. Also, this was my first project with a Mobile First approach, which was essential to be able to adapt the layout and its functionalities to different devices.

In hindsight, I can see how not using a framework would make this multi-page websites difficult to maintain and update. That's why I'm now focusing on learning React JS.

> Make sure you have the Live Server extension installed. If not, you can install it from the VSCode marketplace. Go to the Extensions view in VSCode (click on the square icon on the left sidebar) and search for "Live Server". Install the extension provided by Ritwick Dey.

> Open the folder or project you want to run with Live Server in VSCode. Use the "File" menu and select "Open Folder" to open the desired folder, or simply drag the folder into the VSCode window.

> Once you have your folder open in VSCode, locate the file you want to launch with Live Server, typically an HTML file.

> Right-click on the HTML file in the Explorer sidebar or right-click in the editor window and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Alt+L, Alt+O to open the file with Live Server.

> ‚è© Live Server will launch a development server and automatically open your HTML file in a browser. You will see a new browser tab with the URL http://localhost:5500 (or a different port if 5500 is already in use) displaying your web page.
